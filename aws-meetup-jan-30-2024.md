It's been the AWS Re:Invent meetup organized by AWS Group NL, this time in Utrecht.
Looks like Reinvent conference format matches the one of WWDC, but iOS -> AWS ðŸ™‚.
I got some insights and some networking, which is just great.

The presented AWS updates are related mostly to the Generative AI.  
As far as I undestand, this is no more a hype, but a must-have and must-know piece of technology. 
You might have 10+ years of experience with some language/framework, but get the same results as if you had only 1 year of that experience, and good skills in prompt engineering and a right AI tool at hand.

Notes/links/insights:
+ no one mentioned the language/pricing of any particular AWS service
+ there _were_ mentions of Python, so it should be perfectly OK to use it for a low scale apps
+ AWS AppComposer - looks like I like it very much
+ [the frugal architect checklist](http://thefrugalarchitect.com/)
+ CodeWhisperer + VS Studio integration (OR Github copilot which is not AWS ðŸ˜ƒ). Looks like CW doesn't have Xcode support, but maybe some AI tool does already?
+ I've understood the concept of LLVM "agents" which first saw [here](https://github.com/buhe/langchain-swift), but which were not explained [here](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/198671257-langchain-crash-course)
